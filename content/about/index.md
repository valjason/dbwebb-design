About the techniques
==================
This page is created with a Pico framework. In this theme I've embeded a bit of SASS.
I've used the SCSS format for writing SASS, the current implementations of SASS into the CSS are variables and mixins. I've used mixins to create a bit more responsiveness. The variables were created for easier access of specific colors.

This page also hosts two sets of fonts from Google Fonts, which are 'Architects Daughter' as well as 'Cinzel'. To make this page a bit more user friendly i've included some symbols linking to GitHub, Instagram, Google Fonts and FontAwesome. As well as a few icons for the menu.
