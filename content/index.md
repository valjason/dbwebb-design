Olá
==========================

My name is `Valério Wallin`

And I'm a student at BTH and currently studying design through a webb programming course.

I'm also someone who likes to likes the sun, shrimp sandwich and a cup of coffee.

Maybe this is what I'm going to aim for tomorrow.

At the moment I'm trying to learn Pico.

It's a bit difficult with git

But baby steps.

Programming

Is very fun
